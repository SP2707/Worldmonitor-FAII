  "Market data: sector valuationCoverage distinguishes write age (`stale`) from completeness (`sourceStatus`). `stale` describes the SEED WRITE, not the individual records \u2014 a freshly written payload can still contain older valuations. To tell live data from replayed data, read `currentValuationCount` (valuations actually fetched this cycle; omitted when every record is current) and `staleValuationSymbols` (symbols served from the last-good snapshot, with `lastGood.fetchedAt` giving their age, bounded by a 7-day TTL). `valuationCount` counts stale and live records together, so it alone does not mean that many symbols are current. `unavailableSymbols` lists symbols with NO valuation published and is disjoint from `staleValuationSymbols`. `lastGood.symbols` covers both whole records and borrowed return metrics. `sourceStatus` is `degraded` when no record is current, `partial` when some are stale or missing. Bounded `valuationDiagnostics` explain per-symbol outcomes across the `v7Quote`, `v7QuoteBatch`, and `quoteSummary` routes; direct/proxy outcomes are independently observable and never include credentials."
